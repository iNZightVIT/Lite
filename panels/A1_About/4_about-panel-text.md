By popular demand, it has been extended to support multivariate and time series analysis. <font size = "4" color = "18afe3"><b>i<font color = "094b85">nz</font>ight</b><font color = "094b85"> lite</font></b></font> is an online version of the full software, which goes a long way to make it more accessible to a wide range of users.
