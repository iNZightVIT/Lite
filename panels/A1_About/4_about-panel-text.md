## Getting Started

To get started, import a dataset using the **File** dropdown from the tabs above, and then choose either

- **Import Dataset** if you have your own data to explore, or

- **Dataset Examples** if you're just looking to explore the software using an example dataset.

Not sure what to do? We have made a [getting started video](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~wild/iNZightLite/IntroMovie.html) and there is help available within most modules. Just look for the green "help" button, usually located in the bottom left hand corner of the screen.

## About

**iNZight** is a simple data analysis system which was initially designed for high school students to help them explore data quickly and easily. It still serves this function but other demands have seen extensive additions to its capabilities. For example, it now provides very flexible multivariate visualisation capabilities and supports 3D graphics, maps, time series, and multivariable regression analysis.

**iNZight _Lite_** is an online version of the software accessibly from any modern web browser, thus making it suitable to a wider range of users including non-Windows users who cannot install the desktop software. With Lite, you can import your own dataset or explore one of the many example datasets. You can then visualize and conduct statistical analysis on the data, and even modify the data, to explore hidden secrets behind the data.

## Troubleshooting

Some users are experiencing errors with Lite. You might like to install _Lite_ locally to avoid these issues. Instructions can be found at [the iNZight install page](https://inzight.nz/install/) (Click on 'Mac' and then 'Install Lite locally').

## The iNZight Project
The project is led by [Professor Chris Wild](http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~wild) and has been primarily supported by the Department of Statistics at the University of Auckland, with additional support from Statistics New Zealand and the NZ Ministry of Education via Census at School.

If you are an expert programmer or statistician, you can contribute to the project by sending us feedback about our [R source code](https://github.com/iNZightVIT).
