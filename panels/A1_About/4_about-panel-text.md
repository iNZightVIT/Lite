The desktop application <a href="https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~wild/iNZight/"><font size = "4" color = "18afe3"><b>i<font color = "094b85">nz</font>ight</b></font></a> is a simple data analysis system which was initially designed for high school students to help them explore data quickly and easily. It still serves this function but other demands have seen extensive additions to its capabilities. For example, it now provides very flexible multivariate visualisation capabilities and supports 3D graphics, maps, time series, and multivariable regression analysis. <font size = "4" color = "18afe3"><b>i<font color = "094b85">nz</font>ight</b><font color = "094b85"> lite</font></b></font> is an online version of the software, which requires only access to the internet and a modern web browser, thus making it accessible to a wider range of users.

<br>

<font size = "4" color = "18afe3"><b>i<font color = "094b85">nz</font>ight</b><font color = "094b85"> lite</font></b></font> lets you import your own data set or explore one of the many example data sets; visualize and conduct statistical analysis on the data, and even modify the data, to explore hidden secrets behind the data.

We have made a <a href="https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~wild/iNZightLite/IntroMovie.html"><b>getting started video</b></a> and there is help available within most modules. Just look for the green "help" button, usually located in the bottom left hand corner of the screen.  <font size = "4" color = "18afe3"><b>i<font color = "094b85">nz</font>ight</b><font color = "094b85"> lite</font></b></font> is still under active development and we anticipate that much more of the capabilities of <font size = "4" color = "18afe3"><b>i<font color = "094b85">nz</font>ight</b></font> will be made a available through <font size = "4" color = "18afe3"><b>i<font color = "094b85">nz</font>ight</b><font color = "094b85"> lite</font></b></font> over the coming year.
