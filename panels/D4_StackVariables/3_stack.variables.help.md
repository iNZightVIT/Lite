<h5>Stack variables</h5>
This module multiplies the data by stacking the selected variables on top of 
each other and adding them to the data. Select whether "numeric" or 
"categorical" variables should be stacked. The second select box will be filled 
with the appropriate column names afterwards. Select the columns and press the 
"STACK VARIABLES" button.
