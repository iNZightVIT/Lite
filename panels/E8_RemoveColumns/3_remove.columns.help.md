<h5>Remove columns</h5>
The selected data set is displayed in the table on the left. Select columns which should be removed from the data from the dropdown menu. Only when the "Remove columns" button is pressed the currently selected data set is changed. Be very careful with this feature. Accidently removed columns can only be added by repeating the work which was done to obtain them.
