<h4>Column pair plot</h4>
Select a column from the first drop down menu to plot against a column in the 
second drop down menu. The second menu will be filled when an item from the 
first menu is selected. Below the plot is a blue area. The buttons and slider 
can be used to scroll through the plots quickly.
