<h4>Missing values</h4>
A plot of all missing values is produced. The bars at the top show how moch is
missing (grey) and what not (red). Below the bars all possible combinations of
missing versus not missing is plotted in table like plot. Next to the plot are
the frequencies of the observed combinations.<br>
The blue button labeled "GET TABLE OF ROW COMBINATIONS" produces a table like
represantation of the plot. If this is very complex it can take a while to load.
