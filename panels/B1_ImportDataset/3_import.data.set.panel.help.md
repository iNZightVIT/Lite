<h5>Import Dataset</h5>
To import your own data, press the "Choose File" button. A new window will appear 
which lets you select a file. After that is done the data will be presented to 
you as a table in the middle of the screen. If the file to import is located as 
a web resource at a URL, paste the URL in the blue text field. <br><br>

In any case, press the "IMPORT FILE" button to finalize your choice.

All imported text files are assumed to have a header line and no row names as a 
first unnamed column. The type of the file is estimated from the file extension.<br>
