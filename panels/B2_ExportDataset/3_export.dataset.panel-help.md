<ul>
   <li>
      txt<br>
      A tab delimited text file.
   </li>
   <li>
      csv<br>
      A comma seperated text file.
   </li>
   <li>
      RData<br>
      A RData binary file.
  </li>
  <li>
     RDS<br>
     A RDS binary file.
  </li>
</ul>
Note, "RData" and "RDS" file are R only. They can be loaded into R with the load 
or readRDS function. They have the advantage that no information is lost. The 
txt files (txt and csv) are not able to store some information.
