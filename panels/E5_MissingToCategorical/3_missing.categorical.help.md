<h5>Missing to category</h5>
This module adds additional column with two possible values.
- **observed** the value was observed
- **missing** The value was NA

One or more columns can be picked from the data and how many are missing are 
presented in the table next to the controls. If submit is pressed, for every 
variable picked, another column is added to the data.
