<h5>Add a column</h5>
To add a column to the data set write or paste the values in the text area. The
values can be seperated by comma or every value needs to be on a new line. The
later method is prefered so it is possible to have commas in the new column.
Press the "Add as column" button to add the column to the current data set. By
default the new column is added as categorical variable. For numeric values,
check "Numeric input" checkbox.
