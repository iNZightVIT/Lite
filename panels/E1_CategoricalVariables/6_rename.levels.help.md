<h4>Rename levels</h4>
The levels of a categorical variable can be renamed with this module. Choose a 
categorical variable from the first dropdown menu. A number of text fields will 
appear below. These text fields are filled with all possible levels in the 
selected variable. Change the levels and press the "RENAME LEVELS" button to 
finalize. Unchanged or empty fields are ignored and the old level is kept.
