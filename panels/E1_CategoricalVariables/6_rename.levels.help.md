<h4>Rename levels</h4>
The levels of a categorical variable can be renamed with this module. Choose a
categorical variable from the first dropdown menu. A number of text fields will
appear below. These text fields are filled with all possible levels in the
selected variable. Change the levels and press the "RENAME LEVELS" button to
finalize. Unchanged or empty fields are ignored and the old level is kept.
