Four different actions can be performed.

- **Reorder levels** Changes the order of levels. The default order is 
alphabetical. Note: normal text files such as csv or txt do not store the order 
of levels. You need to store the file in a Rdata or RDS file to conserve the 
order for reloading.
- **Collapse levels** With this module it is possible to collapse two or more 
levels in a categorical variable into one. 
- **Rename levels** This module make it possible to rename the levels of a 
categorical variable.
- **Combine categorical** Several categorical columns can be combined into a new 
column.
