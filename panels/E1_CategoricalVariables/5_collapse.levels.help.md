<h4>Collapse levels</h4>
With the collapse column module several factors in a categorical variable can be 
collapsed into one. Select a categorical column from the first dropdown menu and 
two or more levels from the second menu. If only one is selected the variable 
stays unchanged. Press the "COLLAPSE LEVELS" button to finalize. The main panel 
at the right of the controls shows informations on the levels before and after 
the variable is changed.
