<h4>Reorder levels of a factor variable.</h4>
<h4>Reorder Levels</h4>
This module enables to reorder the levels of a categorical variable. By default 
the level is ordered alphabetically. This order might not make sense in a 
hierarchical relationship among the categorical levels. <br>
Select a column from the first dropdown menu where the order of levels should be 
changed. Numeric columns are not presented. If you want to change the order of a 
numeric column, you need to convert it to a factor first. After a column is 
selected in the first dropdown menu, the second menu is filled with all the 
possible factors in the column. If not all factors are selected, the selected 
factors come first in the order they were selected, followed by the unselected 
columns in the order they were in. Press the "REORDER" button to finalize.
