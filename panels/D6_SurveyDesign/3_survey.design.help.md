<h5>Survey design</h5>
This module is still under development. Some features of iNZight lite will not 
work when it is used. Every design specified is connected to the data set 
selected at the time the design was created. Make sure the right data is 
selected first. If the data set is changed the design is deleted and needs to be 
recreated. <br><br>
The survey design module adds or removes a survey design design to the vizualize 
modules plotting functionality.<br>  
To use this module a survey data set should be loaded. There are four dropdown 
menues and one check box. 
- **strata** The first dropdown menu specifies the strata. Select a variable 
from the list. 
- **clustering** The second dropdown menu specifies the clustering variable or 
id variable in the survey design function (svydesign) More than one variable can 
be selected. The "none" variable which is selected as default is removed from 
the selection internaly and can be ignored. All selected variables are pased 
into the "svydesign" function as formula. The format is "~var1 + var2 + ...".
- **weighting** The weighting variable is the third variable. Please specify on 
what variable the survey design is weighted.
- **nest** Whether it is a nested design or not can be specified with this check 
box.
- **fpc** The finite population correction variables are selected with the last 
dropdown menu. As in **clustering** more than one variable can be selected. In 
fact the number of variables selected for fpc should equal the number of 
variables selected in clustering. <br><br>
For more information please look at the R survey package.
