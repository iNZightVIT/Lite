<h5>Sort variables</h5>
The menu on the left has a text field at the top. This field 
only takes numeric values as input. Specify the number of 
variables the current dataset needs to be sorted on. The panel 
updates to the number of specified or to the maximum number of 
column in the data by displaying as many select boxes below the 
input field. Next to every select box is a checkbox. The 
default ordering for every variable is "decreasing". If 
"increasing" is desired this checkbox can be selected. Each 
select box contains all possible column headers. Unused boxes 
are ignored and variables which are selected more than once are 
ignored.
