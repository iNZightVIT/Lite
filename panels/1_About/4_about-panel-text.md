<font size = "4" color = "18afe3"><b>i<font color = "094b85">nz</font>ight</b></font> is a simple data analysis system which was initially designed for high school students to help explore data fast and easy without having to learn complex statistical software. By popular demand, it has been extended to support 3D graphics, multivariate analysis, and time series analysis. <font size = "4" color = "18afe3"><b>i<font color = "094b85">nz</font>ight</b><font color = "094b85"> Lite</font></b></font> is an online version of the full software, which goes a long way to make it more accessible to a wide range of users.

You can import your own data set or explore one of the many example data sets; Even if you don't have a formal background in computer programming or statistics, you can conduct statistical analysis on the data, and modify it to explore hidden secrets behind the data. If you are an expert programmer or statistician, you can contribute to the project by sending us feedback about our source code on github (click "R Source Code" at the bottom of the screen).
