To do/Known Issues:
-------------------
- [Time Series] Change the way plots are drawn to how it was done in "Visualize".
- [Time Series] "Provide Time Information" needs to be linked to server.R
- [Time Series] Check if it can handle datasets with the "DATE" columns in column 2+.
- [Time Series] Make the "TS" panel conditional on the type of dataset loaded.
- [Quick Explore] Merge into 1 tab.
- [Visualize] Add inferential markups.
- [Advanced] Nest QE and TS under "Advanced".

Directories:
------------
- data:
This directory holds all the data. The data must be placed in sub-directories, which will come up as data categories within iNZight-Lite.

- gui-elements:
This directory contains the gui functions for all the old modules (from iNZight revamp). 

- panels:
This directory contains the gui, server, help, and other functions for each module. It currently contains the "About", "Time Series", "Visualize", and "Help" modules. This makes it easier to modify code.

- www:
This directory is used for web-related files such as .css and .gif/.jpeg/.png. Images are stored in a sub-directory called "images".

Main files:
-----------

- README:
Documentation for iNZight *Lite*. Update as required.

- global.R:
Defines functions and variables that are used globally. For now, all non-GUI functions are stored here.

- server.R:
Script for shiny server.

- ui.R:
Defines the main GUI.

Note:
-----

This repository will gradually be changed into the following format throughout 2015:

- data:
This directory holds all the data. The data must be placed in sub-directories, which will come up as data categories within iNZight *Lite*. 

- panels:
This directory contains the code and files that set up user selections. There is one sub-directory that contains all the .html and .md files.
Each panel has its own directory within 'panels', and each sub-panel has its own directory within each parent panel.

The file names adhere to the following guidelines:

- N_panel-name
- M_sub-panel-name
- 1_panelname-panel-gui.R
- 2_panelname-panel-server.R
- 3_panelname-panel-help.R
- 4_panelname-panel-other.R
