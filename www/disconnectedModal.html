      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>
            If the disconnect occurred after you uploaded some data &hellip;
          </strong>
          <p>
            There may be an issue with the dataset, or Lite is running into
            trouble for some other reason.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>If you haven't already, try loading the data again</li>
            <li>
              If you are on a Mac, ensure you are
              <strong>not</strong> trying to upload a Numbers (.numbers) file,
              as Lite cannot read these
            </li>
            <li>
              Try a different dataset. If you get the same issue, it might be an
              issue with Lite. In that case, please contact us.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>
            If the disconnect occurred after you performed some action &hellip;
          </strong>
          <p>
            This is likely an issue with Lite. Please contact us including the
            dataset and steps taken to reproduce the error.
