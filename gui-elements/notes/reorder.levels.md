<h4>Reorder levels of a factor variable.</h4>
Select a column where the order of levels should be changed. The default order is alphabetically. Numeric columns are ignored as this might lead to a loss of information. If you want to change the order of a numeric column, you need to convert it to a factor first. This can be done at "Transform Columns >> change factor" user interface. It is also possible to make a copy of the original column there. After a column is selected in the first dropdown menu, the second menu is filled with all the possible factors in the column. If not all factors are selected, the selected factors come first in the order they were selected, followed by the unselected columns in the order they were in.
